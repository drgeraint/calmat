LICENCE
-------
The Creative Commons Licence, dated 15/02/2010 and described in CALMAT Downloadable Package Licence.pdf, supersedes the licence embedded in the installers.

AMENDMENTS
----------
Instead of running the CALMAT Setup application, users should replace the copy of calmat.ini created during installation with the version provided in the package.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
The manuals for CALMAT are provided on this CD. We suggest that you print only sufficient copies for those members 
of staff who are using or installing CALMAT, to avoid security problems. 

LEARNING PLANS
--------------
The Plans folder on this CD contains some learning plans. 
These are not essential for using CALMAT, but they do provide a structured approach 
to the material which is similar to that used in the schools.

Copy the Plans folder into the scalmat folder within your CALMAT folder.

Open the text file within the folder containing the set of plans you are using, 
e.g. open plans\scottish\scottish.txt

Copy the entire contents of the file to the clipboard (just highlight everything, 
hold down the Ctrl key and press C). 

Now open the text file scalmat\plans\lessons.txt 

Paste the text on the clipboard after the blank second line of this file 
(by holding down Ctrl and pressing V).

Now when you open the CALMAT Player and click the Learning Plans button, 
these plans will be accessible and you will be able to go to the recommended 
CALMAT components directly from the Player.
