<B><P>Introduction</P></B>
<P>In this Learning Plan we will consider the problem of fitting the ‘best straight line’ through a set of points which do not lie exactly on the line.</P>


<B>Fitting a Line by Eye</b>

<UL>Begin by working through 1-58 <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 58 a 0~?">section a</a>, <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 58 b 0~?">section b</a> and <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 58 c 0~?">section c</a>.   
<Br>In the examples we have assumed that a linear relationship existed between the two variables.   A line was fitted by eye to the data.   However, it is difficult to judge where best to draw the line.   Different people would probably draw slightly different lines.   <B>Regression</B> is a technique to determine the ‘best fitting line’ by the <B>method of least squares</B>.</UL>

<B><P>Linear Regression</P></B>
<UL>It is appropriate to use linear regression, where interest lies in determining the average linear relationship between Y and X.   The resulting line of best fit can then be used to predict y from x.</UL>

<B><P>The Method of Least Squares</P></B>
<UL><LI>We wish to find the equation y = a + bx of a straight line which is the ‘best’ fitting line to the set of data points.   This is an estimate of the true regression line y = <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#97;</FONT>
 +<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#98;</FONT>
x.  
<LI>The method to find the ‘best’ fitting line is known as the method of least squares or linear regression.<Br>

<B><P>Correlation</P>

</B><UL>Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, <B>r</B> is used to measure the strength of the linear relationship between two variables.   
<LI>Note that <B>–1 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#163;</FONT>
  r <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#163;</FONT>
 1</B> where <B>r = -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation</B> and <B>r = 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.
