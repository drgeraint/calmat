<P>It is highly desirable to supplement a statement about the location of a distribution by some indicator of how closely the data are concentrated about the centre.</P>

<P>A measure of variability (or dispersion, scatter, spread) gives the degree to which the data tend to spread about a central value or measure of location.</P>

<P>The difference in variability between data sets can be quantified by defining a measure of dispersion.   The most common measures of dispersion are:</P>

<br>
<UL>
<LI>range</LI>
<LI>variance</LI>
<LI>standard deviation</LI></UL>

<br>
<P>Measures of variability begin on page 19 of your lecture notes.</P>

<B><P>The Range </P>

</B><P>The range of a set of observations is the difference between the largest and the smallest observation in the set.   Work through the details in <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 f 0~?">1-54 section f</a> and consider the example on page 19 of your lecture notes.   Try <a href="launch.htm#q0552">q0552</a> and <a href="launch.htm#q0553">q0553</a>.</P>

<B><P>The Variance</P>
</B>
<P>The variance is (essentially) the mean of the squares of the deviations of the observations about their arithmetic mean.</P>

<P>This will become clearer on reading about the variance on pages 19 and 20 of your lecture notes.   In particular work through Example 9 on page 20.</P>

<B><P>The Standard Deviation</P>

</B><P>The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.  Spend time on <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 57 e 0~?">1-57 section e</a> and <a href="launch.htm#q0547">q0547</a>.   Read the details on pages 20 – 22 of your lecture notes. </P>

<B><P>Interpreting the Standard Deviation</P>

</B><P>Knowing the mean and standard deviation allows the statistics practitioner to extract useful bits of information.   The information depends on the shape of the histogram.   If the histogram is bell-shaped we can use the <B>Empirical Rule</B>.</P>

<P>Empirical Rule</P>

<OL>

<LI>Approximately 68% (about 2/3) of all observations fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</LI>
<LI>Approximately 95% of all observations fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</LI>
<LI>Approximately 99.7% (almost all) of all observations fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</LI></OL>

<br>
<P>The rule is illustrated graphically on page 23 of your lecture notes.   Apply the rule in <a href="launch.htm#q0770">q0770</a>.</P></FONT></BODY>
