<b>Probability as a relative frequency</b>:  This is explained in <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 49~?">Level One, Lesson 49</a> 
<P>Most of us have a good idea of probability because we have all played games of chance,  Snakes and Ladders, Bridge, Roulette, etc.
To recap the the main points of this lesson.</UL>

<LI><b>Sample Space</b>
<UL><LI>This is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
<LI>For example, in throwing a die,  the sample space S (say) is: S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</UL>

<LI><b>Sample Point</b>
<UL><LI>Each possible outcome is a sample point.</UL>

<LI><b>Event</b>
<UL><LI>A collection of sample points with a common property is called an event.
<LI>If a die is thrown and the number less than 3 is obtained,  then this is an event containing the sample points 1 and 2.
<LI>We can write: E = {1, 2}</UL>

<LI><b>Probability</b>
<UL><LI>The probability of a sample point is the proportion of occurrences of the sample point in a long series of experiments.</UL>

<UL><b>Example</b>:A coin is tossed three times.
<br>
<UL><img src="Image28.png"></UL>
<Br>The Sample Space is S= {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}, so there are 8 Sample Points.
<Br> Let A be the event that two or more heads appear consecutively.
<UL>The event A contains the following Sample Points: A = {HHH, HHT, THH}
<br>Here there are 3 Sample Points.
<Br>Hence the probability that A occurs is:
Pr(A) = n(A)/n(S) = 3/8</UL>
 Let B be the event that all tosses have the same outcome.
<UL> The event B contains the following Sample Points: B = {HHH, TTT}
<Br>Here there are two Sample Points.
<Br>Hence the probability of Event B is:Pr(B) = n(B)/n(S) = 2/8 = 1/4</UL></UL>.

<b>Finite Probability Spaces</b>
<P>A <b>Finite Probability Space</b> is obtained by assigning to each point a<sub>i</sub> in the Sample Space, S, a real number p<sub>i</sub>, called the probability of a<sub>i</sub>,  satisfying the following properties:
<UL><LI>Each  p<sub>i</sub> is non-negative, i.e. p<sub>i</sub>>=0, for all i.
<LI>The sum of the p<sub>i</sub> is 1.
<UL>i.e. p<sub>1</sub> + p<sub>2</sub> + ........ +  p<sub>n</sub> = 1</UL></UL>
<UL>i.e. The probabilities add to 1. </UL></UL>

<UL><b>Example</b>
<BR>Three coins are tossed and the number of heads obtained is observed.
<BR>Here the result of the tosses can be:
0 Heads, 1 Head, 2 Heads or 3 Heads.
<BR>So, S = {0, 1, 2, 3,}
<Br>Now Pr(0) = 1/8, Pr(1) = 3/8, Pr(2) = 3/8 and Pr(3) = 1/8
<Br>Note :- Each sample point does not occur with the same probability.
<LI>Let A be the event that at least one Head appears.   Determine Pr(A).
<UL>Pr(A) = Pr(1) + Pr(2) + Pr(3) = 3/8 + 3/8 + 1/8 = 7/8</UL>
<P><LI>Let B be the event that all Heads appear or all Tails appear
<UL> Pr(B) = Pr(0) + Pr(3) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4</UL></UL>

<P><b>Equiprobable Spaces</b>  
<BR>Here the outcomes of the Sample Space are assigned equal probabilities.
<P><b>Example</b>
<Br>In throwing a fair die:
<Br>
<img src="Image29.png">
<Br>Let the event A be defined by "getting at least a 5 on a single throw".   Then A = {5, 6}.
<UL>Pr(A) = n(A)/n(S) = 2/6 = 1/3</UL>
<P><b>Example</b>
<P>Determine the probability of selecting a spade from a set of 52 cards.
<Br>Event A = {card is a spade}
<Br>Pr(A) = n(A)/n(S) = 13/52 = 1/4
