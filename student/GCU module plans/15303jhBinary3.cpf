Hexadecimal Numbers appear in computing because they are a convenient way to represent binary numbers.   These hex (adecimal) numbers are constructed to a base of 16.   In hex notation the symbols 0 to 9 represent the decimal values 0 to 9; the symbols A to F represent the decimal values 10 to 15.

Hex numbers are used mainly as a shorthand for binary numbers.   A 4-bit number can have 16 different combinations, so that the only way to represent each of the 4-bit binary numbers with a single digit is to use a base 16 numbering system.

Most people find it tedious to work in binary.   For example, in a 32-bit computer a binary instruction could appear as:-
<P>
10111001000010110011001011011111
<P>
In hex, it would appear as:-
<P>
B90B32DF

Now try <a href="launch.htm#q0729">q0729</a> and <a href="launch.htm#q0705">q0705</a>.

For people, this form is easier to manipulate.

However, to assist further, mnemonics were developed for machine code.   These assembly languages form a one to one correspondence with machine code.

This little programme can be typed directly into the computer using "debug".   If you decide to do this be very , very careful as mistakes will lead to the computer crashing.
