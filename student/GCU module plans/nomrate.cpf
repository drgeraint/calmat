<P>While working through this plan you should be referring to your lecture notes titled ‘Time Value of Money’.</P>

<P>It is common financial practice to express rates of interest as rates per annum and sometimes a rate is stated as such a percentage per annum, even thought the interest is paid more frequently than once per year.</P>

<P>Consequently, an effective rate of 4.4031% per half year might be expressed as a rate of 8.8062% per annum, payable half yearly (convertible half yearly).</P>

<P>The rate stated at 8.8062% is not an effective rate, it is a rate of interest in name only, and for this reason it is called a nominal rate of interest.   In this case the true (or effective) rate of interest is actually 9% per annum.   Calculations are given in your notes page 10.</P>

<P>Credit card statements can give the effective rate of interest as 2% per month or 24% per annum, payable monthly.   This 24% is a nominal rate for the true rate of interest is ((1.02)<SUP>12</SUP> –1) = 26.82%.</P>

<P>The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the effective rate of interest per annum.</P>
