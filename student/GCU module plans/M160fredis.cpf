</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Data gathered from experiments/surveys may be difficult to understand and interpret in raw form as a series of observations.   It is therefore necessary to try to use appropriate methods to summarise such data in order to derive some meaningful interpretations of them.   Graphical and numerical summaries are two such ways of doing this.</P>

<P>When dealing with a set of data, in which the same observed values are repeated a number of times, it is often helpful to describe the frequency of each observation, i.e. the number of times an observation occurs in the data set.</P>
