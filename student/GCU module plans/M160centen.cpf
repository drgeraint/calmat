<P>A measure of central tendency is a measure which gives the location of the ‘centre’ of the data.</P>

<P>There are several different measures of location or central tendency.   The commonly used ones are the mean, median and mode.   Of these the mean (or arithmetic mean) is the most important as it lends itself to further mathematical treatment, but each of the others has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the data and its intended purpose.</P>

<B><P>The Arithmetic Mean</P>

</B><P>Read pages 15 – 17 of your lecture notes where the calculation of the mean is illustrated.   Work through <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 a~?">1-54 section a</a>, <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 b 0~?">section b</a> and <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 i~?">section i</a>.   Try <a href="launch.htm#q0548">q0548</a>, <a href="launch.htm#q0549">q0549</a> and <a href="launch.htm#q0631">q0631</a>.   Also try <a href="launch.htm#q0767">q0767</a>.</P>

<B><P>The Median</P>

</B><P>If a set of data is arranged in ascending or descending order of magnitude, the median is defined as the value which divides the set into two numerically equal groups i.e. with equal total frequencies.   Read about the median on pages 17 and 18 of your lecture notes.</P>

<P>Spend time on <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 c 0~?">1-54 section c</a> and then <a href="launch.htm#q0630">q0630</a>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>The Mode</P>

</B><P>The mode of a set of observations is the value with the highest frequency (i.e. the most common occurring value), if it exists.   A set of observations may have no mode, it may have one mode (unimodal) or it may have more than one mode (multimodal).</P>

<P>The mode is discussed on page 18 of your lecture notes and also in <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 d 0~?">1-54 section d</a>.   You are asked to find the mode in <a href="launch.htm#q0550">q0550</a> and <a href="launch.htm#q0551">q0551</a>.</P>

<P>Before finishing this Learning Plan work in <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 h~?">1-54 section h</a> where you find the mean, median and mode from a Frequency Table.</P></FONT></BODY>
