<p><b>Johannes Kepler</b>
<ul><li>used Tycho Brahe’s (1546-1601) accurate measurements of positions of planets as they move across the background of stars.  He had access to 20 years of observation data, especially of Mars.</li>
<li>tried 70 different combinations of circles and circles within circles to model the observed motions - finally abandoned circles.</li>
<li>tried ovals, where the speed of the planet changed as it went around the oval.</li>
<li>after 7 years, discovered an <b>ellipse</b> fitted the observations.</li>
<li>Kepler's laws are based purely on the observations. </li></ul></p>

<p><b>Ellipses </b></p>

<p><b>Kepler’s First Law:</b> <br/>
<center><table><tr><td>Each planet’s path around the Sun is an ellipse, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse.</td><td><img src="Orbit.png"></td></tr>
</table></center>
</p>

<p><b>Kepler’s Second Law:</b> <br/>
<center><table><tr><td>A planet moves along its elliptical path with a speed that changes in such a way that a line from the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.
<br/>So a planet moves faster when it’s close to the Sun, slower when farther away.
<br/>In the diagram, area A = area B</td><td><img src="EQualAreas.png"></td></tr>
</table></center>
</p>

<p><b>Kepler’s Third Law:</b> <br/>The ratio of the cube of a planet’s average distance from the Sun to the square of its orbital period is the same for each planet
<br/>This ratio is constant for every body that revolves around the same central body
<br/>eg.  constant for all satellites about Jupiter, and for all planets about the Sun.</p>
<center><table><tr><td><img src="3rdLawFormula.png"></td><td>   a = average distance from planet to Sun<br/>   P = period of planet's orbit (observable)<br/>   K is a constant</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Kepler's third law means that the cube of the average distances of two planets from the Sun is equal to the square of the ratio of the periods of time it takes the two planets to revolve around the Sun. Let subscript 1 denote planet 1 and subscript 2 denote planet 2, then</p>
<center><table><tr><td><img src="3rdLawFormula2.png"></td><td><img src="3rdLawDiag1.png"></td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>We can use Kepler's third law to determine the relative distances from the Sun to the planets in the solar system compared to the distance from the Earth to the Sun. </p>
