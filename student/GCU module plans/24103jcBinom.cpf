<P>There are two types of Probability Density Functions:
<UL><LI>Discrete Probability Functions
<LI>Continuous Probability Density Functions</UL>
Each Density Function has a Distribution Function F where
<UL>F(x) = Pr(X is less than or equal to x)</UL>
<b>Discrete Random Variables</b> have discrete probability density functions.   Such functions often consist of a table of values.
<UL><b>Example</b>
<P>Let X denote the number of heads obtained when a coin is tossed twice.   The Probability Density Function of X is:-

<Br>The Sample Space, S = {(T,T), (T,H), (H,T), (H,H)}.</UL>
In this module, two Discrete Distributions are considered:- The Binomial Distribution and the Poisson Distribution.
<P><b>Binomial Distribution</b>
<LI>The Binomial Distribution can be used to model a wide number of applications;  from quality control to the failure of rocket engines.
<LI>If a series of trials satisfies the following conditions,  then the Binomial Distribution can be used.
<UL><LI>For each trial there are only two possible outcomes,  which are mutually exclusive.   The outcomes can be described as "success" or "failure" (or "Heads" or "Tails", etc)
<LI>Outcomes of individual trials are independent of each other.
<LI>The probability of a "success" in each trial is constant.   It is usually denoted by p,  and the probability of failure by q = 1 - p.</UL>
The Binomial probabilities can be calculated from:-
<Br><img src="Image35.png">
<Br>where
<UL><LI>Pr(X = r) means the probability that the random variable, X,  takes on the value r.
<LI>n = the number of trials
<LI>r = number of "successes"
<LI>p = probability of success in one trial
<LI>q = probability of failure in one trial</UL>
<b>Example</b>
<Br>From all the families which have five children what is the chance that a family has:-
<UL><LI>exactly one boy?
<LI>at least one boy?</UL>
<UL><b>Solution</b>
<Br>Assume that the probability of a boy equals the probability of a girl (ie.each equals 1/2)
<LI>Let p = "the probability a child is a boy" and q = "the probability a child is a girl"
<LI>Here p = 1/2 and q = 1 -  p = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 
<LI>Also n = 5
<Br>Hence Pr(X = 1 boy) 
<Br><UL>= <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub>p<sup>r</sup>q<sup>n-r</sup>
<Br>=  <sup>5</sup>C<sub>1</sub>p<sup>1</sup>q<sup>5-1</sup>
<Br>= (5)(1/2)(1/2)<sup>4</sup>
<Br> = 5/32</UL>
<P>The Pr(at least one boy) 
<Br><UL>= Pr(X = 1) + Pr(X = 2) + Pr(X = 3) + Pr(X = 4) + Pr(X = 5)
<Br>= 1 - Pr(X =0) ;  easier to calculate
<Br>=1 -  <sup>5</sup>C<sub>0</sub>p<sup>0</sup>q<sup>5</sup>;  p= 1/2, q=1/2.
<Br>= 1 - (1/2)<sup>5</sup>
<Br>= 31/32</UL></UL>
<P><b>Example</b>
<Br>It is claimed that 40% of viewers of a particular soap opera can recall the name of the washing up liquid advertised during the commercial break.
<Br>Ten viewers are selected at random.   What is the probability that:
<UL><LI>a) no viewers can recall the product name ?
<LI>b) more than 8 viewers can recall the product name ?</UL>
<UL><b>Solution</b>
<Br>Let p = probability that viewer can recall name = 0.4,  (40% = 40/100 = 4/10 = 0.4)
<Br>Let q = 1-p = 0.6,  n = 10,  viewers
<Br>a) Pr(X = 0 viewers can recall) 
<UL>= Pr(X = 0) 
<Br>=   <sup>n</sup>C<sub>0</sub>p<sup>0</sup>q<sup>10</sup> 
<Br>=  <sup>10</sup>C<sub>0</sub>(0.4)<sup>0</sup>(0.6)<sup>10</sup> 
<Br>= 0.00605</UL>
b)Pr(More than 8 viewers could recall) 
<UL>= Pr(X = 9) + Pr(X = 10)
<Br> = <sup>10</sup>C<sub>9</sub>p<sup>9</sup>q<sup>1</sup> + <sup>10</sup>C<sub>10</sub>p<sup>10</sup>q<sup>0</sup>
<Br> = (10)(0.4)<sup>9</sup>(0.6)<sup>1</sup> + (0.4)<sup>10</sup>
<Br> = 0.000157 + 0.000105
<Br> = 0.000262</UL>
