</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>We have previously solved an equation to find one unknown value.   If we want to find more than one unknown variable we must have more than one independent equation.   To find two unknowns we need two independent equations.   Knowing that 2x + 3y = 2 is not enough to find values for both x and y.   If, however, we also knew that 6x – y = 1 then we would have two independent equations and would be able to find values for both x and y.  </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">2x + 3y = 2</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">6x – y = 1</P>

<P>Sets of independent equations like these are called <B>simultaneous equations</B> or systems of equations.   They can be solved to find values for all the unknowns.</P>

<P>A solution to simultaneous equations can be found:</P>

<B><P>Graphically</P>
</B>
<P>A graph is drawn for each of the equations.   The point at which the graphs meet provides the solution.   We will normally be dealing with linear equations and hence the graph will consist of straight lines.   The solution will be at the point where the lines cross. </P>

<P>Work through <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 26 a~?">1-26 section a</a>, <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 26 b~?">section b</a>, <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 26 c~?">section c</a> and <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 26 d~?">section d</a>.</P>

<P>This method is however often unsatisfactory due to errors in sketching and estimating the point of intersection.</P>

<B><P>Algebraically</P>
</B>
<P>The substitution method or the elimination method can be used to solve simultaneous equations algebraically.   Study the examples given on pages 1-3 of your notes.   Spend time on <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 26 e~?">1-26 section e</a>.  Try <a href="launch.htm#q0604">q0604</a> and <a href="launch.htm#q0016">q0016.</a> </P></FONT></BODY>
