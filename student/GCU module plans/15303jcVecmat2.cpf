<P>A <b>matrix</b>, plural <b>matrices</b> is a <b>rectangular</b> or <b>two dimensional array</b> of numbers. We use capital letters for matrices, ie A, B...
<LI> The horizontal lists of numbers in the array are called <b>rows</b>.
<LI> The vertical lists of numbers in the array are called <b>columns</b>.
<LI>If a matrix has m rows and n columns we say the its size is m by n, we sometimes write mxn.  
<br>
Do <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 3 9 b 0~?">3-9 section b</a>.
<LI> Each number, called an  <b>element</b>, in the array is given a double subscript, the first subscript representing the row and the second subscript representing the column. 
<br>
<P>That is, a<sub>ij</sub> represents the element in the ith row and the jth column. It is called the <b> (ij)th  element or entry</b> of the matrix. 
<LI> If a matrix is denoted  A, then its entries are denoted by  lower case letter a. The shorthand form
<br> A =(a)<sub>ij</sub> is often used.

<LI> Two matrices, A and B, of the same size can be added by adding the corresponding entries, and we denote the sum as <b> A + B</b>. 
<LI> The product of a scalar k and a matrix A is the matrix <b>kA</b> whose (ij)th element is <b>ka<sub>ij</sub></b>, where  a<sub>ij</sub> is the (ij)th entry of A.  Do <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 3 9 f~?">3-9 section f</a>.
<LI> If k = -1, then (-1)A is written <b> -A </b>. Its (ij)th element is <b>-a<sub>ij</sub></b>, where  a<sub>ij</sub> is the (ij)th entry of A.
<LI>  For two matrices of the same size A - B = A + (-B).   Do <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 3 9 e 0~?">3-9 section e</a>.
<LI> Note that all the elements in the matrix A - A are equal to 0 . A matrix with all elements equal to zero is called the <b>zero matrix</b>.
<br>
<LI> A matrix with the number of rows equal to the number of columns is called a <b>square</b> matrix. If the number of rows and columns equals n, the matrix is said to have <b>order n</b>.
<LI> The <b>diagonal of a square matrix </b> A =(a<sub>ij</sub>) of order n consists of  the elements a<sub>11</sub>, a<sub>22</sub>...a<sub>nn</sub>

<LI>A square matrix in which the off diagonal elements are all equal to zero is called a <b>diagonal matrix.</b> The most useful diagonal matrix is the <b>identity matrix</b>, <font face="Times New Roman">I<sub>n</sub></font> all of whose entries are equal to 1. There are diagonal matrices of every order.
<LI>A triangular matrix is one in which a<sub>ij</sub> = 0 if i>j.

<LI> The product of two matrices A and B is only possible if the <b> number of columns of A is equal to the number of rows of B</b>.  This means that if A is an m by n matrix and B is an r by s matrix, the product AB is only possible if n = r.
