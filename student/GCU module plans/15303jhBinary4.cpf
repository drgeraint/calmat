<P>
There is a need to manipulate both positive and negative numbers.   For this reason a scheme is required to resolve potential problems of complicated computer arithmetic.   Such a scheme is the 2's complement scheme.
<P>
For the puposes of illustration, 8-bit binary numbers are used.
<P>Now decimal 0 is represented by 0000 0000.
<P>Decimal 5 is represented by 0000 0101.
<P>
To obtain a representation for -5, we should be able to find a binary representation so that 5 + (-5) = 0.
<P>

<P>
As we are only using  8-bit numbers,  the leading 1 in this calculation is an overflow.   By ignoring the overflow,  an easy representation can be used for negative numbers.
<P>
Using 8-bits with a two's complement scheme,  the largest number and the smallest number are 127 (0111 1111) and -128 (1000 0000) respectively.
<P>
<b>Example</b>
<P>
Using the two's complement scheme for an 8-bit instruction set,  add 17 and -10 (decimal).
