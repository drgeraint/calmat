Multiple Integration - Basics
<br>
<p><font size="+2">
In this section we briefly introduce the mechanics of multiple integration between constant limits.  This represents an 
<br>easy extension of the definite integral that you have already met.</p>
<br/>

<p>An expression such as, </p>

<br/>

</center>

<br/>

<br>which contains two integral signs, is referred to as a double integral.  A more general version (not the most general possible) is <P>

<center> <img src="K:\CALMAT\scalmat\plans\mark\gen2int.png"></center>

<br>where the symbols on the integrals represent constants.
<br>
<P> The evaluation of double integrals proceeds by first evaluating 
the inner integral. (Note that we have been very explicit about which variable goes with which limit).
<br>
<P><center><img src="C:\Top\lade\evalint1a.png"></center>

<P>This leaves a single integral to be evaluated.

<br>
To test your ability with this type of integral try the following 
problems; <P>
<a href="launch.htm#q0800">question 1</a> <br>
<a href="launch.htm#q0896">question 2</a><br>
<a href="launch.htm#q0801">question 3</a><br>
<a href="launch.htm#q0897">question 4</a><br>
<a href="launch.htm#q0895">question 5</a><br>

<p>

<br>Here is a harder example:<p>
<a href="launch.htm#q0906">question 6</a>
<p>
And of course the variables do not have  
to be x and y - try the following 
(use the hint -indicated by the '?'- if you are not sure how to proceed):<p>
 <a href="launch.htm#q0899">question 7</a><br>
<P>

<br> The method extends easily to higher order integrations.  
<br>To ensure that you understand this procedure try the following 
(triple integral) problems.
<p>

<a href="launch.htm#q0907">question 8</a> <br>
<a href="launch.htm#q0810">question 9</a>

<p>

<br>There is no requirement for the integrations to be with respect to x, y and z. Try the following problem, just follow the procedures already described  (If you find this integral problematical, then replace the variables with x and y!).  Note that the problem requires the use of a trig identity - see the hint (indicated by the "?") if you are not sure how to proceed.
