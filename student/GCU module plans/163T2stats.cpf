</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Measures of Location</P></B>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><B><P>The Mean</P></B></FONT>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>A measure of location of a set of data values is a number conveying the idea of a representative value of the data.   Consider first the <B>arithmetic mean</B> or <B>mean</B> for short.   Work through <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 a~?">1-54 section a</a> and <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 b 0~?">section b</a>.   Try <a href="launch.htm#q0548">q0548</a> and <a href="launch.htm#q0549">q0549</a>.  Read through your lecture notes pages 20-22.   You may also find it helpful to consider <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 i~?">1-54 section i</a>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><B><P>The Median</P></B></FONT>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>

<P>Unusually large or small values can distort the mean, making it unrepresentative of the data values.   Work through the example on page 26 of the lecture notes.    When exceptional values distort the mean, another measure of location, the <B>median</B>, may be a more appropriate measure to use.  Work through <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 c 0~?">1-54 section c</a> and read pages 27 and 28 of your lecture notes.   Try <a href="launch.htm#q0630">q0630</a>.</P>
</I>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><B><P>The Mode</P></B></FONT>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>One further measure which can be considered is the <B>mode</B>.  Find the mode in <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 d 0~?">1-54 section d</a> and <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 e~?">section e</a> and in <a href="launch.htm#q0550">q0550</a> and <a href="launch.htm#q0551">q0551</a>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Measures of Dispersion</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>Measures of dispersion reflect the amount of variability in a set of data.   It may be of great importance to know how much variability there is in a collection of observations.   For instance, a manufacturer of laboratory glassware would want to be sure that the true volume of his 10ml pipettes did not vary too widely around 10ml.   Since a certain amount of uncontrolled variation in the manufacturing process is inevitable, routine checks would have to be carried out to ascertain that the random variation was within acceptable limits.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><B><P>The Range</P></B></FONT>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>The simplest measure of spread is the range, defined as follows:</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Range = maximum data value – minimum data value</P>
</B>
<P>Study the range in <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 f 0~?">1-54 section f</a>.   <B>The semi-interquartile range </B>is discussed in <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 57 b 0~?">1-57 section b</a>.   Try <a href="launch.htm#q0552">q0552</a> and <a href="launch.htm#q0553">q0553</a> then read page 28 of your lecture notes.   Attempt <a href="launch.htm#q0557">q0557</a>.
<br>
<P>It is also possible to calculate statistics from a graph or a frequency table.  Complete <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 g~?">1-54 section g</a> and <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 54 h~?">section h</a>.</I>   More detail is given in the lecture notes pages 23-25.   Now try <a href="launch.htm#q0767">q0767</a>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><B><P>Standard Deviation</P></B></FONT>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>The range is not a particularly informative measure of dispersion, since it depends on only two values.   The <B>standard deviation is the most widely used</B> measure of spread.   Work through <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 57 c 0~?">1-57 section c</a>, <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 57 d~?">section d</a> and <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 57 e 0~?">section e</a>.   Move on to try <a href="launch.htm#q0547">q0547</a>.  Now read your lecture notes pages 29 – 33</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><B><P>Interpreting the Standard Deviation</P></B></FONT>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>Read thoroughly and understand pages 34 and 35 of your lecture notes before attempting <a href="launch.htm#q0770">q0770</a>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><B><P>Quartiles</P></B></FONT>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>The mean and standard deviation are a pair of descriptive measures which are usually calculated together, and quoted together.   They provide a concise summary of the location and the spread of the data.</P>

<P>Another measure of the spread of a distribution is given by a pair of summary measures known as <B>quartiles</B>.   There are two quartiles – the <B>lower</B> and <B>upper quartile </B>– and in the same way that the standard deviation is usually quoted along with the mean, the two quartiles are usually quoted with the median.</P>

<P>Work through <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 56 a 0~?">1-56 section a</a>.  The method described in this section is a simplified version of the method in the lecture notes on page 36.   Use the method from 1-56 to answer <a href="launch.htm#q0556">q0556</a>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><B><P>The Box Plot</P></B></FONT>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>Taken together, the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile and maximum of a set of quantitative observations provide a concise summary of the distribution.   They split the data into four parts, each containing approximately 25% of the observations.   In particular, the interval between the lower and upper quartiles contains 50% of the data.</P>

<P>The <B>Box Plot</B> is a useful graphical representation of these five descriptive measures.  Study the Box Plot in <a href="runcal.htm#==C:\CALMAT\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 56 b 0~?">1-56 section b</a>.  More details can be found on pages 38- 40 of your lecture notes.   Finally try <a href="launch.htm#q0558">q0558</a>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Minitab Lab</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>Now use Minitab to help with the interpretation of the mean and standard deviation.   Follow through and carry out the steps detailed in <a href="http://www.maths.gcal.ac.uk/m163/lab1a.mpj">Lab 2</a> printed in Laboratory Handbook 1. </P>
You should now have <b>completed Laboratory Handbook 1</b>.   This should be handed in for correction in the week beginning <b>24/02/03</b>.
