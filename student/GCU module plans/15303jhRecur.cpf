<P>However, obtaining the roots of  2x<SUP>4</SUP> + x<SUP>3</SUP> – 3x<SUP>2</SUP> + 4x –1 = 0 or the equation x = sinx, is not so straightforward.   There is no known formula by which these roots can be obtained directly.   Instead a method called <B>iteration</B> is used.</P>

<P>Iterative processes require:</P>

<OL TYPE="i">

<LI>a starting approximation, x<SUB>0</LI>
</SUB>
<LI>a formula for obtaining the next iteration x <SUB>n+1</SUB> in terms of previous approximations.</LI></OL>

<br>

<br>
<P>Consider the equation</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">2x<SUP>3</SUP> – 7x + 2 = 0</P>

<P>A sketch of this graph shows that there are three roots; one between –2 and –1,  a second between 0 and 1, and a third between 1 and 2.</P>

<P><img src="Image49.png"></P>

<P>The equation can be re-written as follows</P>

<P>7x = 2(x<SUP>3</SUP> + 1)</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#222;</FONT>
 x = 2/7(x<SUP>3</SUP> + 1) ; x =f(x)</P>

<P>here, the root between 0 and 1 will be determined by setting x<SUB>0</SUB> = 1 and by using the formula</P>

<P>x <SUB>n+1</SUB> = 2/7(x<SUB>n</SUB><SUP>3</SUP>+1)</P>

<P>Hence,</P>

<P>x<SUB>1</SUB> = 2/7(1<SUP>3</SUP> + 1) = 0.5714</P>
<P>x<SUB>2</SUB> = 2/7((0.5714)<SUP>3</SUP> + 1) = 0.3390</P>

<P>It is more usual to lay out the work in tabular form:-</P>

<P><img src="Image50.png"></P>

<P>Rounding to four decimal places, the process has converged to 0.2929.</P>

<P>The equation x <SUB>n+1</SUB> = 2/7(x<SUB>n</SUB><SUP>3</SUP> + 1)</P>

<P>Is called a <B>recurrence relation</B> (or difference equation).   The final value (if it exists) is the solution of the recurrence relation.  The process of obtaining the solution from the recurrence relation by repeated applications is called <B>iteration.</P>
</B>
<P>From the previous graph of the equation 2x<SUP>3</SUP> – 7x + 2 = 0, there is a second positive root between 1 and 2.   Starting the process with x<SUB>0</SUB> = 2 and using the formula</P>

<P>x <SUB>n + 1</SUB> = 2/7(x<SUB>n</SUB><SUP>3</SUP> + 1)</P>

<P>gives</P>
<P><img src="Image51.png"></P>
<P>Here the process is diverging, and no matter how many iterations are carried out, it will never give the root between 1 and 2.   It is important to note that <B>not all</B> iterative processes <B>converge</B>.</P>

<P>Other recurrence relations can be formed from the equation;</P>

<P>2x<SUP>3</SUP> = 7x – 2</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#222;</FONT>
 x = (7x – 2)/2x<SUP>2</P>
</SUP>
<P>Set x<SUB>0</SUB> = 2 and use the recurrence relation</P>

<P>x<SUB>n+1</SUB> = (7x<SUB>n </SUB>- 2)/2x<SUB>n</SUB><SUP>2</P>
</SUP>
<P>The following table for this process can be constructed:-</P>

<P><img src="Image52.png"></P>

<P>Note that as</P>

<P>x = ((7x-2)/2x)<SUP>1/2</SUP> </P>

<P>or x = ((7x-2)/2)<SUP>1/3</P>
</SUP>
<P>two other recurrence relations could have been formed.</P>
