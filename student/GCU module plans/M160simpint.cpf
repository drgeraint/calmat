<P>While working through this plan you should be referring to your lecture notes titled ‘Time Value of Money’.</P>

<P>We have all come to value money for what it can buy us now and for what it can buy in the future.  We continually decide whether to purchase items now with the aid of a loan or wait until or savings are sufficient.   In making these decisions we need to consider how much the loan would cost and how long saving would take.</P>

<P>The performance of a business for the most part is assessed in terms of monetary value.   Decisions will continually need to be made between competing projects with differing costs and differing returns over time.   We begin our study of the ‘Time Value of Money’ with Simple Interest.</P>

<B><P>Example</P>
</B>
<P>If £20.00 is invested at a rate of interest of 10% per annum (per year) then after one year the amount of interest earned on this amount is</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">£20.00 x 10/100 = £20.00 x 0.1 = £2.00</P>

<P>(10% = 10/100)</P>

<B><P>Simple Interest</P>
</B>
<P>Here money is invested, the interest is paid out and not re-invested.   The amount of simple interest, I, at the end of each year is:-</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">I = A<SUB>0</SUB> x r/100</P>

<P>where A<SUB>0</SUB> is the initial sum invested and r is the annual rate of interest expressed as a percentage.</P>

<P>As interest is paid out each year, the amount of interest gained over t years is I x t, and the value of the investment is given by</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">A<SUB>0 </SUB>+ It</P>
