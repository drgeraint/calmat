The following lessons provide the basic knowledge you should have before you start Calculus. This should not be new, although I recognise that some of you may be a bit rusty.
I suggest that you do the assessment in each lesson first, and then go back and go over the tutorial that are recommended if you have difficulties.

<P>There is no learning material in these lessons; if you need more help, you should go back to Level One. You will see from the titles which Level One Lessons you need.
<P> Do not get bogged down on a particular section and be aware that most students have gaps in some of these topics.
<P>If you are going to complete all the tasks that are ahead, you should not spend more than one week on this.

<UL><b>You can use these Learning Plans interactively by entering the Player and choosing Fire Risk Engineering-Fire Mathematics. You can then follow the hotlinks in the  university system or your home computer, if you have bought the CALMAT system. Alternatively you can enter the CALMAT system and use MoLs for lessons and TAS for questions. If the computer that you are using is slow, this latter way of working is better.   
<P>
When you have finished these four learning Plans, there are nine Learning Plans on Data Analysis and these should be completed, when you have finished the Fire Mathematics Learning Plans. Although there are more plans for Data Analysis, you should find them easier. The assessment for this module is continuous. You are required to complete the assigned sections in order to complete the module.
