</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>While working through this plan you should be referring to your lecture notes titled ‘Time Value of Money’.</P>

<P>You should have realised that when Simple Interest is paid the principal (initial investment) does not increase as each year’s interest is paid.   This is contrary to our normal expectation.   If a principal of £500 were deposited at an interest rate of 10% per annum then after one year had passed the interest payment due would be £50.   We would then expect this to be added to the principal and the following year’s interest to be calculated on £550.  This is known as Compound Interest.</P>

<B><P>Compound Interest</P>
</B>
<P>Here money is invested and the interest is added to the sum saved.   This total sum is re-invested and the sum grows larger each year.</P>

<P>For example, if the capital (principal) is A<SUB>0</SUB>, the rate of interest is r and the sum after t years is A<SUB>t, </SUB>then:</P>

<P>After 1 year</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">A<SUB>1</SUB> = A<SUB>0</SUB> + A<SUB>0</SUB>(r/100) = A<SUB>0</SUB>(1 + r/100)</P>

<P>Follow how the capital increases in your notes on page 2.</P>

<P>In general terms, after t years</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">A<SUB>t</SUB> = A<SUB>0</SUB>(1 + r/100)<SUP>t</P>
</SUP>
<P>Work through lesson <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 3 2 b~?">3-2 section b</a>.   Study the examples on pages 3 and 4 of your notes.</P>

<P>Try <a href="launch.htm#q0223">q0223</a> and <a href="launch.htm#q0234">q0234</a>.   Also work on <a href="launch.htm#q0236">q0236</a>.</P>

<P>Interest paid monthly, quarterly,…</P>
</B>
<P>Some investments yield (give, pay, accrue) interest on a monthly, quarterly or half yearly basis.</P>

<P>For example, if interest is paid half yearly and the rate of interest per half year is 5% then after one year:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">A<SUB>1</SUB> = A<SUB>0</SUB>(1 + 5/100)<SUP>2</P>
</SUP>
<P>Expanded details are given in your notes on page 5.</P>
