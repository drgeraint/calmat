<P>Many studies or experiments involve taking measurements on a sample of people, animals, plants or products.   It is usual to take a sample that is random and representative of the population under study.   Statistical inference deals with the question of what can be inferred about the population from a sample (ie what can we say about the population from data collected on a sample).   Statistical inference will only be valid if the experiment has been properly designed to ensure that a sample is random and representative of the population.  </P>


<B><P>Distribution of the Sample Mean</P></B>
<Br> The serum bilirubin (mg/100cc) of a random sample of nine healthy 4 year old infants was recorded.</P>

<UL>If we were to have measured the serum bilirubin levels of a different sample of infants then our estimate of the mean would be slightly different.  We require to know how much the sample mean varies from sample to sample.</UL>

<Br>We should note that variability from sample mean to sample mean is much less than the variability from individual to individual.   The distribution of sample means is known as the <B>Sampling Distribution of the Sample  Mean</B>.   In particular we should note that the Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean</P>

<OL TYPE="i">

<UL><LI>has the same mean as the population</LI>
<LI>has less variability than the population</LI>
<LI>has a Normal Distribution when the population has a Normal Distribution.</LI></OL>

<br>
<P>In fact the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means (known as the <B>standard error</B> of the sample means to distinguish it from the standard deviation of the population of individual values) is given by the formula <B><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#115;</FONT>
