<UL>

<br>The background material for this unit is covered in Level One, Lesson 41 which you did in the third Learning Plan of Mathematics 1. There you learnt about straight lines. The equation of a straight line is a linear equation and you should already know how to solve linear equations.
<P> Here you will see how you can solve two linear equations, that is, find the values of x and y which satisfy two linear equations.
 Complete <a href="runcal.htm#==k:\calmat\tcrun.exe calpopup //?~ 0 1 26~?">Level One, Lesson 26</a>, including the assessment.<Br>
<Br> You should then try the TAS questions :-
