<P><b>Independent Event</b>
<P>Two events E<sub>1</sub> and  E<sub>2 </sub> are said to be independent if the outcome of one event has no effect on the outcome of the other.
<P>Here, Pr(E<sub>1</sub> | E<sub>2 </sub>) = Pr(E<sub>1</sub>), that is, the event  E<sub>2 </sub> has no effect on  E<sub>1</sub>.
<P><b>Example</b>
<P>A die has just been tossed and it is a six.   What is the probability that the next throw will be a six ?
<P>Given that the die is fair, what has happened on the previous throws will have no effect on the next throw.
<P>Hence, Pr(next throw is a six) = 1/6.
<P><b>Dependent Event</b>
<P>Two events  E<sub>1</sub> and  E<sub>2 </sub> are said to be dependent if the outcome of one event effects the outcome of the other.
<P><b>Example</b>
<P>From a group of 10 people, 5 men and 5 women, the Pr(selecting a man) = 5/10 = 1/2.
<P>If a second person is selected from the remaining 9 people then the probabilities will depend on the first selection.
<P>If a man was selected first time then
<P>Pr(second person is man) = 4/9
<P>Pr(second person is woman) = 5/9
<P>Also, if a woman was selected first time then
<P>Pr(second person is man) = 5/9
<P>Pr(second person is woman) = 4/9
<P><b>Joint Event</b>
<P>The probability of the joint event (E<sub>1</sub> and  E<sub>2 </sub>) can be obtained from
<P>Pr(E<sub>1</sub>| E<sub>2 </sub>) = Pr(E<sub>1</sub> and  E<sub>2 </sub>)/Pr( E<sub>2 </sub>)
<P>=> Pr(E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub>) = Pr( E<sub>2 </sub>)Pr( E<sub>1 </sub>| E<sub>2 </sub>)
<P>Also Pr(E<sub>1</sub> and  E<sub>2</sub>) = Pr( E<sub>1 </sub>)Pr( E<sub>2 </sub>| E<sub>1 </sub>)
<P>Whilst these relationships apply to both dependent and independent events, if the events are independent then
<P>Pr(E<sub>1</sub> |  E<sub>2</sub>) = Pr( E<sub>1 </sub>),  so that the above relationship simplifies to
<P>Pr(E<sub>1</sub> and  E<sub>2</sub>) = Pr(E<sub>1 </sub>)Pr(E<sub>2 </sub>).

<P><P><b>Example</b>
<P>What is the probability of drawing two aces (without replacement) from  pack of well shuffled cards ?
<P><b>Solution</b>
<P>Let event E<sub>1</sub> = draw ace on first card
<P>Let event E<sub>2</sub> = draw ace on second card
<P>Here Pr(E<sub>1</sub> and  E<sub>2</sub>) = Pr( E<sub>1</sub>)Pr(E<sub>2</sub>|E<sub>1</sub>) = (4/52)(3/51) = 3/663 = 1/221
