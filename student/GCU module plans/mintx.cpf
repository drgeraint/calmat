<br>The integrals that we have dealt with so far heve been with respect to x and y variables. This need not be the case: consider the integral (old Q0806)
<br>

<br>This can be solved by just as in the x, y case.
<br>

<br>

<br>
NOTE: In some applications we find it desirable to choose a co-ordinate system - such as a polar coordinate - in which to formulate the multiple integral.  This very important aspect of multiple integration is noy covered here.
