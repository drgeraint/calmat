<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#ff0000"><b>Do not use a calculator in this Learning Plan. You will not be allowed to use one on the wards!<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#000000"></b>

<P>We will begin with a quick revision of the sorts of calculations which you will need.Try the following questions: <a href="launch.htm#q0930">930</a>, 
 <a href="launch.htm#q0931">931</a>,  
<a href="launch.htm#q0932">932</a>, 
<a href="launch.htm#q0933">933</a>, 
 <a href="launch.htm#q0935">935</a> 
 <a href="launch.htm#q0936">936</a>  ,
<P>Most of the calculations you do will involve the metric system.

<P>
For mass- <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#ff0000">
<b><UL><LI>one kilogram(kg) = 1000 grams(g)
<LI>one gram(g)         =1000millgrams(mg)
<LI>one milligram(mg)=1000 micrograms <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#000000"></b>
<LI>one microgram=1000 nanograms
<LI>one nanogram = 1000 picograms</UL>
<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#ff0000">
<P>You must remember the equivalences which are in bold red.<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#000000">

<br>For volume- <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#ff0000">

<b><UL><LI>one litre(L)         =1000millilitres(mL)
<LI>one milliltre(mL)=1000 microlitres</UL> <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#000000"></b>

<P>You must remember the equivalences which are in bold red.<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#000000">

<P>You can see from the units above that multiplying and dividing by powers of 10 is going to be very important. To make sure that you are able to do these calculations quickly and accurately, try  <a href="launch.htm#q0289">289</a> as often as you need unless you are sure that you understand. Do not use a calculator!
<P>Now try to do some conversions. Apart from remembering the basic equivalences, you will just use the idea of ratio to perform the calculations. In time, you may be able to skip the intermediate steps in the solution, but do not do this until you really understand what you are doing. Do the following two questions as often as you need to be sure that you could do them in your sleep! 
<br> <a href="launch.htm#q0937">937</a>  and <a href="launch.htm#q0938">938</a>
